# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

As part of my internship at United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I designed and developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze the company's financial performance. The first step in this project involved preprocessing the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, such as Month Name and Day, ensuring data consistency by correcting data types, and establishing key financial formulas such as Profit (calculated as Sales minus COGS) and Sales (derived from Gross Sales minus Discounts).
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of essential financial metrics, including Total COGS, Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Discount, and Total Units Sold. By visualizing these KPIs, the dashboard offers actionable insights into revenue trends, discount implications, and overall profitability, enabling better strategic decision-making.  
Through this experience, I strengthened my skills in data cleaning, financial analysis, and Power BI visualization, which allowed me to effectively interpret and present financial data in a meaningful way. The project files have been uploaded to GitHub, making them accessible for further development and reference.
